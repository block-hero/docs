## Improve performance

If Block Hero is running slowly, try these solutions.

## Clear browser cache

Cached data can slow down your experience:

2. Clear browsing data
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Clear data

## Check your internet speed

Slow internet can affect performance:

1. Run a speed test at speedtest.net
2. If speed is below 5 Mbps, contact your ISP
3. Try using a wired connection instead of WiFi

## Reduce browser extensions

Too many browser extensions can slow things down:

1. Disable unnecessary extensions
2. Keep only essential extensions active
3. Restart your browser

## Optimize your projects

Large projects can impact performance:

1. Archive old projects you're not using
2. Remove unused files and data
3. Keep your projects organized
